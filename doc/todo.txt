Change property 'ivyProperties' to 'ivyVariables'
Is it working?

Change variablizeProjStrings setting to projIvyVariablePrefix.

Add setting to auto-add all confs.

Fix exclude specifications.
    Don't know if Gradle dependency-specific ones support narrowing to a conf.
    'dependencies' level Ivy ones shoudl default to configuraitons.all*, and
     can definitely narrow to confs.

Needed test cases:
    dependency attributes
        branch, force (unsupported AFAIK no branch support in Gradle)
    Exclude for every supported attribute, both depencies child and dep child.
     Ivy supports org, module, artifact, type, ext, matcher, conf
       conf equivalent to nested <conf name="x"/> elements.
     Gradle map not explicit, but I guess group, name, version,
      definitely 'module', configuration?, artifact?

Can Gradle take a list of exclude confs... I doubt it.
