Change variablizeProjStrings setting to projIvyVariablePrefix.

Add setting to auto-add all confs.
With current manual-conf-add, do add required ancestor confs automatically.

Fix exclude specifications.  First have to find out how to get the Ivy side
specifications for it, and I am not finding this in the Ivy API.
    Don't know if Gradle dependency-specific ones support narrowing to a conf.
    'dependencies' level Ivy ones should default to configuraitons.all*, and
     can definitely narrow to confs.
