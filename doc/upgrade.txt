Important information for users upgrading Ivyxml


GOTCHA TIPS:

    * Version 1.0.* and later require Gradle 2.0 or later.
    * Version 0.3.* and later require Gradle 1.0-milestone-6 or later.
      (This is due to compatibility-killing Groovy upgrade in Gradle).
    * If you upgrade gradle to milestone-6, completely wipe out your Gradle
      cache at $HOME/.gradle.  Nasty, confusing problems may result if you do
      not.  This has nothing to do with Ivyxml, but with Gradle caching.


Recent functional changes.

    Gradle 2.0 stopped making the Ivy API visible to Gradle scripts.
    Consequently, version 1.0.* and later of Ivyxml has a buildscript-level
    dependency upon the Ivy jar.
    If you pull this plugin from a proper repository using either the
    buildscript or new plugins script block, the Ivy jar will be downloaded
    automatically.
    If you bundle the Ivyxml jar file locally, then you will now also need to
    bundle the Ivy jar (as exemplified in the main Ivyxml documentation).

    See item abouts <dependency><exclude> and <dependency><dependency><exclude>
    under "UNSUPPORTED" in the main Ivyxml documentation.

    With version 0.3.1 added support for <dependencies><exclude> elements.
    Thanks for Steven Dick for the contribution.

    The following behaviors changed after v. 0.2.1.
        ~ Support for Java system property "ivy.dep.file".  Search for
          "system property" below for details.
        ~ Plugin property name 'ivyProperties' changed to 'ivyVariables'
        ~ Plugin boolean property 'variablizeProjStrings' replaced with
          String property projIvyVariablePrefix.
          Search for "projIvyVariablePrefix" below for details.
        ~ By default every configuration referenced in the ivy.xml file is
          automatically instantiated if it does not already exist.
          Default usage much simplified since the user doesn't have to do any
          Configuration setup ahead-of-time.  This behavior can be toggled with
          new boolean property 'instantiateConfigurations'.
          See fine points in the SETTINGS section of the main Ivyxml
          documentation if you will be setting 'instantiateConfigurations' to
          false.
