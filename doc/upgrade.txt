Important information for users upgrading Ivyxml


GOTCHA TIPS:

    * Version 0.3.* and later require Gradle 1.0-milestone-6 or later.
      (This is due to compatibility-killing Groovy upgrade in Gradle).
    * If you upgrade gradle to milestone-6, completely wipe out your Gradle
      cache at $HOME/.gradle.  Nasty, confusing problems may result if you do
      not.  This has nothing to do with Ivyxml, but with Gradle caching.


Recent functional changes.

    See item abouts <dependency><exclude> and <dependency><dependency><exclude>
    under "UNSUPPORTED" in README.txt.

    With version 0.3.1 added support for <dependencies><exclude> elements.
    Thanks for Steven Dick for the contribution.

    The following behaviors changed after v. 0.2.1.
        ~ Support for Java system property "ivy.dep.file".  Search for
          "system property" below for details.
        ~ Plugin property name 'ivyProperties' changed to 'ivyVariables'
        ~ Plugin boolean property 'variablizeProjStrings' replaced with
          String property projIvyVariablePrefix.
          Search for "projIvyVariablePrefix" below for details.
        ~ By default every configuration referenced in the ivy.xml file is
          automatically instantiated if it does not already exist.
          Default usage much simplified since the user doesn't have to do any
          Configuration setup ahead-of-time.  This behavior can be toggled with
          new boolean property 'instantiateConfigurations'.
          See fine points in the SETTINGS section of README.txt if you will be
          setting 'instantiateConfigurations' to false.
