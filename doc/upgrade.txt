Important information for users upgrading Ivyxml


GOTCHA TIPS:

    * Version 0.3.* and later require Gradle 1.0-milestone-6 or later.
      (This is due to compatibility-killing Groovy upgrade in Gradle).
    * If you upgrade gradle to milestone-6, completely wipe out your Gradle
      cache at $HOME/.gradle.  Nasty, confusing problems may result if you do
      not.  This has nothing to do with Ivyxml, but with Gradle caching.


Recent functional changes.
    With release 1.0-milestone-6, <dependency><exclude>s stopped having an
    effect.
    I don't yet know if this is a problem with Gradle or with this plugin, but
    I have already expended more time on it than is justified for a feature
    that I am not using now.
    Until this is resolved, be aware of using 
        <dependencies><dependency><exclude>
    elements.  3 unit tests of this plugin project will continue to fail until
    this is resolved.
    It is possible that this may get fixed with Gradle 1.0-milestone-7.
    To find out, you can ask me, or you can pull the source code for this
    project and run the Gradle task 'test'.
    I will fix this when somebody lends a hand, or when I need this feature
    (like to narrow transitive dependencies).

    New users can safely skip the remainder of this section.

    The following behaviors changed after v. 0.2.1.
        ~ Support for Java system property "ivy.dep.file".  Search for
          "system property" below for details.
        ~ Plugin property name 'ivyProperties' changed to 'ivyVariables'
        ~ Plugin boolean property 'variablizeProjStrings' replaced with
          String property projIvyVariablePrefix.
          Search for "projIvyVariablePrefix" below for details.
        ~ By default every configuration referenced in the ivy.xml file is
          automatically instantiated if it does not already exist.
          Default usage much simplified since the user doesn't have to do any
          Configuration setup ahead-of-time.  This behavior can be toggled with
          new boolean property 'instantiateConfigurations'.
          See fine points in the SETTINGS section below if you will be setting
          'instantiateConfigurations' to false.
